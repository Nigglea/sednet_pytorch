# Polyphonic Sound event detection network implemented in Pytorch
Repository to host a degree project for Acoustic Civil Engineering & MsC in Informatics.

## Database
pending.

## Feature Extraction

In order to extract information we will use for the first instance, the logarithmic Mel spectrogram.

## Neural network

The neural network used was Polyphonic-SEDnet designed by Adavanne et al.(2017)
